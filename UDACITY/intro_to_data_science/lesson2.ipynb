    "    In this exercise, we will perform some rudimentary practices similar to those of\n",
    "    an actual data scientist.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Part of a data scientist's job is to use her or his intuition and insight to\n",
    "    write algorithms and heuristics. A data scientist also creates mathematical models \n",
    "    to make predictions based on some attributes from the data that they are examining.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We would like for you to take your knowledge and intuition about the Titanic\n",
    "    and its passengers' attributes to predict whether or not the passengers survived\n",
    "    or perished. You can read more about the Titanic and specifics about this dataset at:\n",

    "    http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted/data. \n",

    "    For this exercise, you need to write a simple heuristic that will use\n",

    "    \n",
    "    You prediction should be 78% accurate or higher.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Here's a simple heuristic to start off:\n",
    "       1) If the passenger is female, your heuristic should assume that the\n",
    "       passenger survived.\n",
    "       2) If the passenger is male, you heuristic should\n",
    "       assume that the passenger did not survive.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    You can access the gender of a passenger via passenger['Sex'].\n",
    "    If the passenger is male, passenger['Sex'] will return a string \"male\".\n",
    "    If the passenger is female, passenger['Sex'] will return a string \"female\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    Write your prediction back into the \"predictions\" dictionary. The\n",
    "    key of the dictionary should be the passenger's id (which can be accessed\n",
    "    via passenger[\"PassengerId\"]) and the associated value should be 1 if the\n",
    "    passenger survied or 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, if a passenger is predicted to have survived:\n",
    "    passenger_id = passenger['PassengerId']\n",
    "    predictions[passenger_id] = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    And if a passenger is predicted to have perished in the disaster:\n",
